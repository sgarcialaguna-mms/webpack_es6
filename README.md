# Webpack & ES6

A small repo which shows the usage of Webpack + ES6 in a Django project. 

I used the AngularJS + RequireJS example from TodoMVC as a starting point: http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs_require/

This presentation by Kent C. Dodds takes a similar approach (and inspired my own talk),
it doesn't cover Django however: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEJyIBwo-ik
